# Twitch API Demo
>Demonstration of the Twitch API to show the status of all featured channels on Twitch. This demo uses AJAX calls to the Twitch API to get a list of all featured channels. Then it loops through all of these channels to determine if they are online or not. Then it returns the logo, title, status and description for each channel.
